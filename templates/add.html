        Although most paragraphs should have a topic sentence, there are a few situations when a paragraph might not need a
        topic sentence. For example, you might be able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates a series of events,
        if a paragraph continues developing an idea that you introduced (with a topic sentence) in the previous paragraph, or if
        all the sentences and details in a paragraph clearly refer—perhaps indirectly—to a main point. The vast majority of your
        paragraphs, however, should have a topic sentence.
